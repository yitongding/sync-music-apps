# Sync Music Apps

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Sync the songs you 'liked' across music apps.

## Why?

Personal radio on music apps nowadays use machine learn to figure out what kind of songs you like, based on the songs you 'liked' before, and your listening history.

This is a big problem now, especially in China, where people have to switch apps all the times, as different app holds different copyright of songs.

This project is intend to help you:

1.  Sync these data across multiple music apps
2.  Migrate these data from one app to another, so your new app won't have to learn you preferences from scratch.

## Plan

I think this will be a desktop app runs on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) , since I work with react and would like to learn electron. [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) for mobil app is also something I would really like to learn, but, we'll see if I have time.
